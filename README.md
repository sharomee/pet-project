# pet-project
**Hello everyone !**

This is my first repository dedicated to creating pet projects that I did while learning the Python programming language.



1. The first program "Password Generator"

The password program is easy to use
You don't need to install additional libraries since they are already there inside Python
You just need to specify the password length and get the result

2. Second program “sort-load”

I download a lot of files into my downloads folder, and to make it easier to access the files, I developed a simple way to sort them into separate folders for Videos, Programs, Images, and the like.

Before using the program you will need to install one library "shutil"

```
pip install shutil
```
